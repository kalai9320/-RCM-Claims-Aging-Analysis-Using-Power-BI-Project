# -RCM-Claims-Aging-Analysis-Using-Power-BI-Project

This project focuses on analyzing Claims Aging in US Healthcare Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) to understand where Accounts Receivable (AR) gets delayed and what factors contribute to aging risk.

🎯 Project Objective

To identify AR concentration across aging buckets and analyze how payer behavior, claim types, network status, denials, and partial payments impact payment timelines.

🔍 Key Analysis Areas

AR distribution across aging buckets

Payer-wise and claim-type-wise aging patterns

Impact of in-network vs out-of-network claims

Role of denials and partial payments in AR aging

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Power BI (Dashboarding & Visualization)

Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)

DAX (Measures, KPIs, Aging Calculations)

Python (Data Preparation & Analysis)

📈 Outcome

The dashboard provides clear visibility into AR health and highlights high-risk aging areas, helping support data-driven reviews and operational decision-making in healthcare RCM environments.

Note: This project was developed purely for learning and portfolio demonstration purposes using synthetic data designed to closely resemble real-world US Healthcare RCM scenarios. No real patient, payer, or organizational data was used.
